# What is a ModMail?

A ModMail is a Discord bot that enables private, secure and smooth communication between server members and the staff.

## How does it work?

When a member sends a Direct Message (DM) to the bot, it will create a channel in the selected server and category, where only the staff can read and reply to your messages.

When the conversation is finished, a log file is generated so that the staff can check closed threads whenever they need to.
