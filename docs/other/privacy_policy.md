# Privacy Policy

*This Privacy Policy was last revised on 25 July 2021.*

## 1. Types of Data we Store.

### Self-Hosted Version.

All your ModMail data is stored in the MongoDB database you create, so nobody related with the bot has ever access to it.
<br/>
Please, refer to [MongoDB's (Atlas) privacy policy](https://www.mongodb.com/legal/privacy-policy) to know how is your data stored.

### Paid-Host Version.

Note that this information is stored as long as you are using the service specified on the [Hosted Version](/hosted_version.md) tab of this documentation.

We store all data related to "threads", including messages' content, author, files and timestamps in order to serve users "thread logs".
<br/>
We also store your ModMail configuration settings.

Nobody except for the people with access to the logs related to your ModMail "threads" can see your content.

We can also provide, edit or remove information if requested by Discord or other legal entity.

## 2. Control of Your Data (Paid-Host Version only).

If you ever want your data removed from our servers, please contact us so that we can shut down your service and remove your data as requested.

## 3. Copyrighted Material.

If you find anyone using copyrighted material of your own property through our systems, please contact us so that we can remove it immediately, providing us with some evidence of your ownership over such material.

## 4. Access to Your Discord Server.

If you need help related with the ModMail bot, you can allow (invite) us to join your server so that we can help you. We can also get your guild ID to look for any hypothetical errors in our database related with your server or your bot.

## 5. Changes To This Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy is subject to occasional revision, and if we make any substantial changes, we will notify you through the [Discord support server](https://discord.gg/aUNhdFD).
