## How to buy an instance?

1. Please join the [support server](https://discord.gg/aUNhdFD) and contact the bot **Mail Support**, telling that you want to buy an instance.
   <br/>
   Indicate the amount of time you want to pay for and take into account that <u>PayPal</u> is the only payment method.
2. Have the following information prepared.
   - Server ID where you want replies to go to.
   - Name of your bot.
   - Image of your bot.
3. Wait until you get a reply.

We will set your bot up as soon as we have received the payment.
