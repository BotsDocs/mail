# Create a Discord bot

Creating a Discord bot is a very important step to create your own ModMail. This will allow you to change its name and avatar to your desire.

- Go to [Discord's Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and login with your Discord account.
- Click over the **New Application** button.

- Enter a name for your app (ideally the name you want for your bot) and create the App.
- Add an avatar if you want to and head to the **Bot** tab. Once there, click over **Add Bot**.

- Disable the **Public Bot** toggle so that nobody but you can add the bot to their servers. You also need to enable **Privileged Intents**.

- Go to the **OAuth2** tab and select <u>*Bot*</u> in the first checkbox list. Then select <u>*Administrator*</u> in the second one. Copy the link and open it in your browser so that you can add the bot to your Discord server.
